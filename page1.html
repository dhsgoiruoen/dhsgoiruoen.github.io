<h1> Track and Field  </h1>
<p> This was the CCA that I chose without hesitation.</p>
<p> During the sports trial, the moment coach told me that I had potential, I decided to hone my skils in this very CCA to make my coach proud. </p>
<p>I knew that Coach took the risk to place me in this CCA as I only tried out running 100m during the trials. Unsure of my other abilities but putting his trust in me, Coach decided to just give it a shot and allow me to enter Track and Field. Due to this very reason, I want to prove to Coach and myself that he made the right choice.   </p>
<p> I aim to work hard, push my limits, challenge myself to better improve my abilities. I know I can do it as long as I don't give up, because I myself, is my obe and only competitor. </p>
